## Description

Here you can find python codes for some tasks to do with raspberry pi sense hat. 
You can run the codes on an emulator if you don't have a raspberry pi.
The simulator called Trinket: https://trinket.io

### Lab3
In this laboratory you will find some codes about the symmetric and the public
key cryptography. Those concepts are important in several embedded systems application
where you have to hide information from possible attackers.
- Inside the Lab3 you will find:
* Lab3_3 --> Caesar cipher - encryption.
* Lab3_3A --> The same as Lab3_3 but modified so that the program be able to handle upper case letters.
* Lab3_4 --> Caesar cipher - decryption.
* Lab3_6 --> Public key cryptography.
* Lab3_7 --> Choosing public key to use with the Caesar cipher.

#### Lab4
The Sense HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi. It gives you the opportunity to interact
with the world that surrounds us, and to create interesting applications. On-board sensors
enable you to gather data from accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, pressure, humidity
and temperature sensors. Then, with the help of the RGB LEDs, you can create visual feedback.
- Inside the Lab4 you will find:
* Lab4_3 --> Hello LED matrix.
* Lab4_4 --> Display a letter “A” on your Sense HAT.
* Lab4_5 --> Display your name.
* Lab4_7 --> Draw a smiley face to the LED matrix.
* Lab4_9 --> Depending on which way the joystick was pressed, display one of the letters U, D, L, R or M
on the LED matrix.
* Lab4_10 --> Change the image white balance.
* Lab4_11 --> Electronic dice.
* Lab4_12 --> Improved electronic dice.

##### Lab5
The Sense HAT has a set of environmental sensors for detecting the surrounding conditions.
It can measure orientation, pressure, temperature, and humidity. The main topic of this lab is
the data acquisition from Sense HAT’s sensors.
- Inside the Lab5 you will find:
* Lab5_5 --> Acquire data from sensors.
* Lab5_6 --> Weather forecast.
* Lab5_7 --> Weather logger.
* Lab5_9 --> Detecting movement.
* Lab5_11 --> Electronic compass.
* Lab5_12 --> 4-piont compass.

###### Lab6
We already know how to turned a LED on and off on the Sense HAT. In this laboratory, you
will create some well-known applications such the Knight Rider running light and traffic light
control.
- Inside the Lab6 you will find:
* Lab6_1 --> Blinking LED control with button.
* Lab6_2 --> Traffic light.
* Lab6_2a --> Traffic light in a single function.
* Lab6_2b --> Traffic light synchronization.
* Lab6_3 --> Knight Rider light bar.

####### Lab7
In this lab, you will create some games using the Sense HAT and some Python code. One of
them is the Pong game. Pong is one of the oldest graphical games ever created, and was
originally played on an oscilloscope!
- Inside the Lab7 you will find:
* Lab7_2 --> Catch the ball game.
* Lab7_3 --> Simplified Pong game.
* Lab7_4 --> final Snake game.
