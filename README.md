## Description

Here you can find python codes for some tasks to do on the raspberry pi sense hat. 
You can run the codes on an emulator if you don't have raspberry pi.
The simulator called Trinket: https://trinket.io

### Lab3
In this laboratory you will find some codes about the symmetric and the public
key cryptography. Those concepts are important in several embedded systems application
where you have to hide information from possible attackers.
Inside the Lab3 you will find:
* Lab3_3 Caesar cipher - encryption.
* Lab3_3A The same as Lab3_3 but modified so that the program be able to handle upper case letters.
* Lab3_4 Caesar cipher - decryption.
* Lab3_6 Public key cryptography.
* Lab3_7 Choosing public key to use with the Caesar cipher.

### Lab4
The Sense HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi. It gives you the opportunity to interact
with the world that surrounds us, and to create interesting applications. On-board sensors
enable you to gather data from accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, pressure, humidity
and temperature sensors. Then, with the help of the RGB LEDs, you can create visual feedback.
Inside the Lab4 you will find:
Lab4_3 Hello LED matrix.
Lab4_4 Display a letter “A” on your Sense HAT.
Lab4_5 Display your name.
Lab4_7 Draw a smiley face to the LED matrix.
Lab4_9 Depending on which way the joystick was pressed, display one of the letters U, D, L, R or M
on the LED matrix.
Lab4_10 Change the image white balance.
Lab4_11 Electronic dice.
Lab4_12 Improved electronic dice.

### Lab5
The Sense HAT has a set of environmental sensors for detecting the surrounding conditions.
It can measure orientation, pressure, temperature, and humidity. The main topic of this lab is
the data acquisition from Sense HAT’s sensors.
Inside the Lab5 you will find:
Lab5_5 Acquire data from sensors.
Lab5_6 Weather forecast.
Lab5_7 Weather logger.
Lab5_9 Detecting movement.
Lab5_11 Electronic compass.
Lab5_12 4-piont compass.
